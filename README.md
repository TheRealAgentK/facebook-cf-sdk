# Welcome to the Facebook CFML SDK
As of 29/07/2014 this project has been transferred from the stewardship of [Benoit](http://www.twitter.com/benorama) into [my ownership](http://www.twitter.com/AgentK) and is active again. Working with me on this is [Ross](http://www.twitter.com/fingersdacing) and this work is kindly supported by one of our clients. Other 3rd-party contributions and suggestions are very welcome.

Benoit's team has completely migrated from CFML to Grails in 2013 and provides now support for [Facebook SDK Grails Plugin](https://github.com/agorapulse/grails-facebook-sdk).

Please find the updated README content for Version 3.1.1a below - this will be looked at further and updated soon.

Facebook CFML SDK - V3.1.2 (12/08/2014)
========================================

# Plans for V3.2.0 (TBA)

* Support for API versioning in the CFCs

# Release notes for V3.1.2 (12/08/2014)

* Some minor documentation fixes (links etc)
* There are two working and correct examples of how to use the FB CFML SDK with a CFML-only login flow as well as a JS-Login-to-CFML flow: /examples/website/serversideflow.cfm and /examples/websites/j2serversideflow.cfm
* Bugfix (879a1a5897378ca5edf21f96ba3ed1c220690613): Fixes an issue with the CSRF stake token to be regenerated wrongly
* Improvement (83f67df61f34c0d772d9fe7d299807afacf8a79d): getUserAccessToken is now aligned with the latest version of the FB PHP SDK version 3 branch --- this involves taking care of a token exchange automatically (NOTE: might be breaking your app/site)
* Improvement (83f67df61f34c0d772d9fe7d299807afacf8a79d): exchangeAccessToken sets the extended access token and its expiry time in the persistent scope automatically now so that it can be used as a stand-alone function from your app/site

# Release notes for V3.1.1a (05/08/2014)

* Some minor documentation fixes (links etc)
* Bugfix (dc3231fed7c5b6f869d10fdf3759a6c88c62b08a): Preventing Adobe ColdFusion's broken serialisation to JSON from breaking return values from FB in certain instances

# General Introduction

The [Facebook Platform](http://developers.facebook.com/) is a set of APIs that make your application more social. Read more about [integrating Facebook with your web site](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web) on the Facebook developer site. 

This project contains the open source **Facebook CFML SDK** that allows you to integrate the [Facebook Platform](http://developers.facebook.com/) on your website powered by a CFML-based application server, [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion) or [Railo](http://www.getrailo.org/index.cfm/download).

**Facebook CFML SDK** provides 3 components :

* **FacebookApp.cfc** - A library to build [apps on Facebook.com](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/) and [websites with the Facebook Platform](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web) (the library is a complete port to CFML of the [Facebook PHP SDK V3.1.1](http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk)).
* **FacebookGraphAPI.cfc** - A client wrapper to call Facebook Graph API (the wrapper is inspired from the latest official .NET and Python SDKs graph clients).
* **FacebookRestAPI.cfc** - A client wrapper to call the old Facebook Rest API.
